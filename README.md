A game that I have enjoyed playing ever since I was a child was the RPG Maple Story. My implementation of the game uses the same images and similar sprites as the original but the game will be implemented differently overall. The game will be both keyboard and mouse controlled. The left and right arrow keys will move the player left and right, respectively. The 'x' key will allow the user to jump and the 'z' key will allow the user to attack (All of this information can be found in the instructions screen). There will be a NPC in the game to sell potions to the player and each potion will restore the player to full health points and will cost 1000 gold. The player can buy these potions by pressing the spacebar or by clicking the NPC with their mouse. The game will start off allowing the user to choose either a male or female character. Then, the user starts at stage 1 and a set of monsters will spawn along with a single boss monster. The user can move on to the next stage once the boss has been killed. There are four stages in total. The objective of the game is to kill as many monsters as possible and to collect the gold coins that they will drop in random amounts. The game will end once all four stages have been completed or when the playerâ€™s health points reach zero.The user's score, the time it took them to win and the amount of gold they collected, is saved in a file. The shortest clear time and greatest amount of gold collected is showcased in the hall of fame.
